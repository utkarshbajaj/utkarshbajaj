# Hi there  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, this is Utkarsh.

I'm a Master's student in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, with a passion for solving complex problems through software. Formerly a Software Engineer at Microsoft, where I worked on cloud infrastructure projects and containerization.  I enjoy tackling technical challenges and continuously exploring emerging technologies.

Actively seeking summer 2025 internships.
