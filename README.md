# Hi there  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, this is Utkarsh.

I am a Software Engineer at Microsoft. As a part of Azure core, the Azure Automation service runs 3B+ jobs (customer code) yearly in 55+ regions spread across the globe. I am a part of the engineering team that ensures these jobs run smoothly and securely, while also working on what the next generation of automation looks like.
